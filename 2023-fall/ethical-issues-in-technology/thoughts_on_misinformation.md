### A short essday on misinformation

I feel frustrated by the division our world as a whole is going through.
It's become so advantegous for organizations and nations to tell lies; fabricate their own versions of the truth that is far from the real truth; and just ignore the parts of the truth that's not beneficial to their agenda.

What's more -- as long as one organization or a nation continues to do so, it's extremely hard for other organizations and nations to not follow suit.
In a world where everyone plays the dirty way, those of us who refuse to do the wrong and try to do the right way almost always gets disadvantaged by all of the other dirty players.
What a tragedy!
Our world has a whole has so much potential.
What are we fighting for?
Yes, many fights are worth fighting for, but it's such a tragedy our society is so vulnerable to malicious actors.

As we learned previously in class, the information bubble keeps reinforcing the bias in each one of us.
Everyone who is unaware of this misinformation bubble will never realize they've never had the chance to look at the whole truth clearly.
Pity on them.
I wish everyone was able to realize almost nothing we fight for these days is worth dying or killing for.
Again, some fights are worth dying for, and I myself would deem beyond honorable to do the right, but we need to keep in mind our perception of right and wrong shall never be manipulated by the dirty players of the world.
