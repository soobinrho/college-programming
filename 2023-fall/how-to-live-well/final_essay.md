### 1. What’s Your Beliefs About Reality?

Let me start with what I don't know for sure.
I believe I don't have enough evidence to prove the existence of God, nor the absence of God.
I don't know exactly how time works.
Can we freely move around time with technological advances in the future, just as we can walk around in the three dimensions of space, or is it impossible to move back and forth around time?
I don't know a lot of things, and there are still many things I still need to learn about the Universe we live in.
One of beliefs I have, however, is that the purpose of life is not a predefineable thing; rather, I believe the purpose of life is a concept that can be defined differently depending on whom it is defined on.

This belief of mine has one major implication: we get to decide what is the purpose of life for ourselves.
This means personal freedom for us to choose what is a good life, and live up to it.
Two or more people might share the same belief, or one might just have a unique belief.
The validity of one’s good life does not depend on how others decide to live their lives.
At the same time, it does not mean that everyone must have their own definition of a good life.
Instead, it's just that everyone can, not must, have their own definition of a good life.
As a matter of fact, we most often share a lot of things in common in what we think of as living a good life – e.g. eating healthy or having a safe shelter from dangers.
Nevertheless, it is up to each one of us to fine-tune and decide what exactly it means to live a good life.

### 2. What is a Good Life?

Among all the philosophical bodies I've learned from this class, the two ideas that I resonate with the most are from Epicureanism and Buddhism.

> "While every pleasure is naturally good, not every pleasure should be chosen. Likewise, every pain is naturally evil, but not every pain is to be avoided.
Only upon considering all consequences should we decide."
(How to be an Epicurean by Catherine Wilson, pg. 2)

This is an idea that we may seek pleasure, but not in the simple sense that we should mindlessly choose pleasure over what is good for us; rather, it's the idea that certain actions that seemingly induce pain may lead to greater happiness.
Yes, seek pleasure, but not just short-term pleasures.
Seek pleasure as in life-long happiness in a well-thought way.
Thus, it is wise to evaluate our own actions as much as we think are necessary, and make a conscious decision on the best course of action for ourselves; for our friends; and for our loved ones.

> "Our true home is not in the past.
Our true home is not in the future.
Our true home is in the here and the now.
Life is available only in the here and the now, and it is our true home … There are those of us who are alive but don’t know it."
(2019, The Practice of Mindfulness, Thich Nhat Hanh, pg. 1)

In the recent past, I often looked into myself and saw a man trying so hard to reach happiness through achievements, discipline, and hard work.
I didn't know it at the time, but I was fixiaited on the future, and had almost no regards for my present self; for my friends; and for my loved ones.
What does it matter if I don't care for them today?
All the work I put in for the future will mean nothing to me, if I neglect my present self.
In the same way, I often realized I regret too much from the past.
Mistakes I've made and wrongs I've done to other people – good people trying to survive as best as they can.
It is obvious now, but it is meaningless to continuously think about the past and get trapped in it.
As long as lessons have been learned, it's best that we leave the past in the past.
The future and the past seem to have been my focus for the past few years.
Buddhist idea of being in the present resonates with me strongly, and I intend to live these principles from now on.

### 3. Three Things I Learned from This Class

> 1. Meditate at least 10 minutes a day everyday. At the same time, try not to be stressed about it. If circumstances don't allow for it, feel free to skip a day.

One of the things I had to do for this class was to watch the documentary “Minimalism.”
One thing I remember from this documentary, which also happens to be what the narrator says at the ending, is something along the line of “love people, and use things because the opposite never works."
This aligns really well with the Buddhist idea of focusing on the present as well – care for the past and the future by learning from the past and preparing for the future, but do not neglect the present.
All of these led me to do meditation ten minutes everyday.
With this, I'm able to prevent myself from making the same mistake I made so many times before – i.e. neglecting the present.
Just ten minutes a day.
That's all it takes.

By the way, meditation happens to have a really cool effect.
Worrying about anticipated hardships tends to cause pain in the brains, when you look at them in an MRI scan.
Likewise, even after the pain itself, the brains tend to have lingering pain for a while (assumably from after-thoughts about the pain itself).
However, if you look at the MRI scans of meditation practitioners, the results are vastly different.
Their MRI scans showed that meditation practitioners’ brains do not light up with pain in anticipation or in aftermath, unlike the other group who do not regularly do meditation.
(2023, The Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley).
How cool is that?
Yes, the meditation practitioners did feel the same pain when the pain itself was being administered during the experiment, but there was a huge difference in the anticipation period and the aftermath period.
What this suggests is that meditation may help me deal with pain much more easily.
Life, as always, is expected to give me a lot of pain, just as much as it will give me a lot of happiness.
Meditation, it seems, will help me ease a lot of the pains and gain strength to live a life I want.

> 2. Keep track of daily progress. (Have I done my daily meditation or not? Have I done a daily exercise on mind palace or not? Have I done 29 push-ups or not?)

Tracking progress makes a big difference.
If I don't track these in any way, it's very possible that I slip and never return again, and in fact, that's what happens every single time in the past whenever I tried to make a difference in my life.
Habits, as you know, are extremely hard to change.
Tracking daily allows me to always remember what I intend to do.
It's so easy for anyone to forget exactly what it is they wanted their entire life and end up in the tragedy of not being able to live a life they want.
That is a tragedy I dearly want to avoid – forgetting to live.

> 3. Implement Haidt's Adversity Hypothesis. 

Always allow myself to learn from adversity and gather strength. As Haidt suggested, not everyone recovers and learns from adversity. Doing so require share with supportive friends and be optimistic.

### 4. Reflection on the Past 113 Days

I wanted to help the environment in any way I can because - well, you know - the earth doesn't seem to be doing too well.
The problem, however, was that I realized it's really hard for normal people like me to make an impact.
Yes, maybe nations or big organizations might be able to make a difference, but it's really hard for regular people to make a big difference.
So, I asked people who actually work in the environment everyday because they surely know about problems that have a big impact.
So, I googled 50 random beekeepers; called their number; and asked them, "I want to help you save bees.
What can I do for you? I can program."
That's how I and my friends made [BeeMovr](https://beemovr.com), which is a map created to solve one of the problems, which beekeepers said is really important.

I would like to live a life, in which I go to people who work in the environment everyday, such as beekeepers or farmers, and ask them what kind of problems they have.
I'll then use my technical knowledge to help them solve those exact problems.
This, in turn, will make an impact on the world.
I would love to live a life dedicated for environmental sustainability.
