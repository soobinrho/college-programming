For the example writeup image,
I needed to add a light grey (HTML Color Code F6F8FA)
border around it so that it doesn't just blend in too much
with a white background -- e.g. GitHub on desktop.

I used Gimp. 'Filter' 'Decor' 'Border' size 4, D value 1

Plus, you can see the HTML color code on any website on Chrome
on Chrome Developer's mode by typing Ctrl + Shift + c

***Computer Science I***, Summer 2022 **[[Python Jupyter Notebook Example](https://github.com/soobinrho/college-programming/blob/main/summer_2022/computer_science_I/15_final_project.ipynb)]**

A course on basic programming with `Python`.

```Python
# When I was writing a paper for my Calculus II class,
# I happened to be in a situation where
# I had to draw a right-angle triangle
# to demonstrate how trigonometric substitution
# for integration works. Using Matplotlib and seaborn,
# I was finally able to draw a right-angle triangle,
# but it took me around five hours to do that.

# That's why I chose to write this
# `Graph_Right_Angle_Triangle` class. I wanted
# to write a wrapper for Matplotlib and seaborn
# such that I can draw a right-angle triangle
# easily and quickly, and that's what I did.

# Making an instance and calling .show() to graph the triangle.
triangle_1 = Graph_Right_Angle_Trinalge(len_adjacent=12, len_opposite=12)
triangle_1.show()

# Graphing another instance.
triangle_2 = Graph_Right_Angle_Trinalge(len_adjacent=12, len_opposite=7)
triangle_2.show()
```

"A Note About Git Commit Messages" by Tim Pope
https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html

Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated
by commands like git merge and git revert.
