## Coursework Examples

For the example writeup image,
I needed to add a light grey (HTML Color Code F6F8FA)
border around it so that it doesn't just blend in too much
with a white background -- e.g. GitHub on desktop.

I used Gimp. 'Filter' 'Decor' 'Border' size 4, D value 1

Plus, you can see the HTML color code on any website on Chrome
on Chrome Developer's mode by typing Ctrl + Shift + c

**Computer Science I**, Summer, 2022 [[Python Jupyter Notebook Example](https://github.com/soobinrho/college-programming/blob/main/summer_2022/computer_science_I/15_final_project.ipynb)]\
A course on basic programming with Python.

```Python
# When I was writing a paper for my Calculus II class, 
# I happened to be in a situation where 
# I had to draw a right-angle triangle 
# to demonstrate how trigonometric substitution 
# for integration works. Using Matplotlib and seaborn, 
# I was finally able to draw a right-angle triangle, 
# but it took me around five hours to do that.

# That's why I chose to write this 
# `Graph_Right_Angle_Triangle` class. I wanted 
# to write a wrapper for Matplotlib and seaborn 
# such that I can draw a right-angle triangle 
# easily and quickly, and that's what I did.

# Making an instance and calling .show() to graph the triangle.
triangle_1 = Graph_Right_Angle_Trinalge(len_adjacent=12, len_opposite=12)
triangle_1.show()

# Graphing another instance.
triangle_2 = Graph_Right_Angle_Trinalge(len_adjacent=12, len_opposite=7)
triangle_2.show()
```
