## Highlights

Media, whether traditional media like news channels or non-traditional media like Snapchat, are incentivized to oversimplify the news because viewership tends to decrease if the news becomes too complicated.
News are inherently a narrative to facts, and a single source of media alone can rarely present the whole picture.
News are not facts -- they are a narrative, meaning that they can deliberately or unintentionally change the narrative of the facts.
Therefore, it is necessary to avoid echo chambers (do not depend on a single stream of media), and always try to assemble the whole picture of the facts.
