***What does this program do?***
The main purpose of this program,
which is named `listCourses.java`, is to
display all courses including
who is teaching the course and
which students are enrolled in it.
In order to run it, type this
into your terminal:

```bash
# Compile.
javac listCourses.java

# Run.
java listCourses
```

The program first reads `courseList.txt`,
`facultlyList.txt`, and `studentList.txt`;
then, it prints each course information along with
the corresponding faculty and students list.
Here's what the output would look like:

```


```

***Additional Functions***
This program also has additional functions:

1. `StudentTest.java` creates 20 instances
of the class *Student* and shows examples of
how you can get and set attributes, such as
*expGradDate* and *crTaken*.

## Detailed Design Approach

Everything you need to know in order
to run the program was shown above.
This section is for those who want to
get a better understanding of what
happens behind the scene each time
the program is run.


```java
System.out.println("t");
```
