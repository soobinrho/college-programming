# Algorithms
These are the problem sets I really liked from books or LeetCode.
All of them contain test cases using `catch2`.

<br>

***List of Algorithms***
```
keeping-index.cpp
palindromes-inside-substrings.cpp
parsing-logs.cpp
...
```

<br>

***How to Compile and Run***
```bash
# Compile example
g++ -o _ palidnromes-inside-substrings.cpp catch2/*

# Run
./_ -s
```
