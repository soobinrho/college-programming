# Final Project Todo
- Uses C++ CLI framework.
- Fancy CLI if the program was run without any argument,
  but if arguments are given silent except for git outputs.
- Use GitHub API for getting the list of repositories.
- Two options for selecting which folder to run:
  One, a whole directory -- e.g. ~/git
  Two, one specific repository - e.g. ~/Documents/backup
- An idea for the final project: basically
PullGitAll and StatusGitAll and
DownloadGitAll
- To be honest, I wouldn't use it with a
GUI, but will make one for learning purposes.
Mainly, it'd be used as a CLI just like
GitHub CLI.
- DownloadGitAll can maybe work by using
API's from GitHub, or I could parse from
the website directly.
- User configurations would include
the directory to PullGitAll and StatusGitAll;
the directory to download DownloadGitAll
althought it will download in the current
directory by default; and GitHub user ID.
Do not use GitHub token because I want to
minimize security risks.

# Calculator Todo
- First, use regex to see if the input
is valid.
- Sort multiplication and division first
and then addition and subtraction.
- Vectors to store numbers in order and
operations in order. The operations vector
will have 1 less item than that of numbers.
- Calculate.

# Final Project Idea
- Course Schedule Optimization Program
- No need to finish it for this class.
Instead, laying out the foundation would be enough.
Complete the program with enough time. Don't rush.
- Genetic algorithm to optimize
