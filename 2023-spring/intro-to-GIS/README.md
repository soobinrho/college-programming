## `Things I Wish I Knew in My Freshman Year at Augustana University`

Elements of operating systems. In this class, we referenced two textbooks:
*Operating Systems and Middleware: Supporting Controlled Interaction* by Max Hailperin
(https://gustavus.edu/mcs/max/os-book/) and
*The Linux Command Line* by William Shotts.
(https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php)

For one of my class lab sessions, I had to write a virtual memory simulator
in C, with support for such functions as `int physAddr = MMU(virtAddr);` which
stands for Memory Management Unit. (MMU)

Also, cool places within walking distance that we can go without a car.
