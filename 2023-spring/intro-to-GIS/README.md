> ***What is this repository for?***<br>
> My college sophomore year, I was taking a class called *Intro to GIS*, and I felt like
> I've learned so many things from this class that I had to make a webpage to help me remember
> what I learned from this class. These will come handy when
> I need to make some kind of maps in the future, whether it be a map for my personal projects
> or maps for research findings.
>
> In this portfolio, I explain what kind of maps I made in this cass, and also where and
> how I got the data for the map-making process.
> Why? I believe that - by doing so - I'll be able to remember what I learned in this class better.
> This portfolio is not only a showcase for you, the reader, but also for my future self. Enjoy! ðŸ˜Ž
