## `Which States Have the Most Number of Domesticated Honey Bee Colonies?`

Actually, the lab instructions were calling for just a state instead of all states, but I had to make this map about all states because I realized making this map will be tremendously helpful for my Call for Code project. My team is trying to help beekeepers, and in turn, bees. We want beekeepers to be successful in their beekeeping as much as possible. We called around 50 beekeepers, and got this one really interesting problem that one of the beekeepers told us.

Beekeepers really need us to create a map that shows you the nectar availability prediction of a selected region. We are going to create a website called either https://aiforbees.com or https://beekeepersmap.com (Please let me know if you have a really cool name idea!). Basically, it‚Äôs going to be exactly like Google Maps, but with a nectar availability prediction functionality.

Now, as I am working on this project, I thought this lab is a good opportunity to get a glimpse on how many bee colonies there are in each county. This has several benefits: (a) I will have a better understanding of how many beekeepers there are, and (b) I have a feeling that this map will be very useful later down the road somehow when we finish developing the web application.

## `Which States Have the Most Number of Healthcare Workers Per Total Population?`

For this lab, I had to learn how to find appropriate data from U.S. Census Bureau (https://data.census.gov/); `Table join` to combine multiple data sources; and use `Data` and `Export Features` functions to make a separate table of the joined tables.

In US, up to 10% of the population is employed by the healthcare sector. In particular, Massachusetts has the highest number of percentage of healthcare workers. In South Dakota, around 8% of the population is working for the healthcare industry.

## `Things I Wish I Knew in My Freshman Year at Augustana University`

Every time I woke up early in the morning my freshman year to walk to my classes in
Froiland Science Complex (FSC), I always wondered exactly how long it takes to walk
from where I live to the FSC. So, here you go. I made a map of exactly that,
so that you don't have to.

In my case, this helped me know how late I can wake up for morning classes.
Hope it helps you too somehow üëçüëç

In addition, the map in the middle shows you every place I wish I knew as
as a freshman, since I didn't have a car by then.
All of these places are within walking distance.

Also, cool places within walking distance that we can go without a car.
