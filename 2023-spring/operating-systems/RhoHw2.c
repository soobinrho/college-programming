 *    Hw2: Two Arrays
 */ 

/*
Create a C program that reads in two arrays of integers (of the
same size) from stdIn (prompt the user).  You will create and
initialize them in the mainline routine.  You will then add them
together, storing the result in another array.  Write a
separate function to print an array (you will print all
three arrays with separate calls to the print function)
and a separate function to add the arrays.  Each routine
(mainline or function) should be in a separate file.
This program will follow the ANSI-C standard and must compile with GCC on the system you chose to work on.   You may use any editor.
