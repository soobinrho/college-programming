- An idea for the final project: basically
PullGitAll and StatusGitAll and
DownloadGitAll
- To be honest, I wouldn't use it with a
GUI, but will make one for learning purposes.
Mainly, it' be used as a CLI just like
GitHub CLI.
- DownloadGitAll can maybe work by using
API's from GitHub, or I could parse from
the website directly.
- User configurations would include
the directory to PullGitAll and StatusGitAll;
the directory to download DownloadGitAll
althought it will download in the current
directory by default; and GitHub user ID.
Do not use GitHub token because I want to
minimize security risks.
